Required Pipeline Status:

Go to Settings > Merge Requests in your project.

Enable "Pipelines must succeed".

Add sonarqube-mr-check as a required status check under Merge Checks.

Security Policies (Optional but recommended):

Navigate to Security & Compliance > Policies.

Create a Scan Result Policy:

yaml
Copy
scan_result_policy:
  name: "Require SonarQube Quality Gate Pass"
  description: "Block MRs if SonarQube Quality Gate fails"
  enabled: true
  rules:
    - type: scan_finding
      scanners: [sast]
      vulnerabilities_allowed: 0
  actions:
    - type: require_approval
      approvals_required: 1
Step 4: SonarQube Configuration (Server Side)
Configure GitLab Integration:

In SonarQube, go to Administration > ALM Integrations > GitLab.

Enable Merge Request Decoration to show SonarQube results directly in MRs.

Generate a SonarQube Token and configure it in GitLab CI variables as SONAR_TOKEN_PROD.

Quality Gate:

Define strict Quality Gate rules in SonarQube (e.g., coverage thresholds, zero new vulnerabilities).
