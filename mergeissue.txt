# Protected Branch Configuration & Merge Request Troubleshooting  
*Best practices for Git branch protection and resolving merge request issues*

---

## 1. Protected Branch Default Configuration  

### **Recommended Settings**  
- **Push Access**:  
  🔒 `Developers + Maintainers` → Set to **0 (No one)**  
  *Rationale*: Prevents direct pushes to critical branches (e.g., `main`, `production`), ensuring all changes go through merge requests.  

- **Merge Access**:  
  🔑 Configure to allow **Developers + Maintainers** to merge after approvals.  

---

### **How to Verify/Update Settings**  
1. Navigate to **Repository Settings > Protected Branches**.  
2. Select the branch (e.g., `main`).  
3. Confirm:  
   - *Allowed to push*: `No one`  
   - *Allowed to merge*: `Developers + Maintainers` (or your approval group)  
4. Update if deviations are found.  

❗ **Warning**: Never grant push access to protected branches without strict justification.

## 2. Merge Request Approved but No Merge Button?  
*Troubleshooting guide for invisible merge button*

### **Scenario**:  
- Merge Request (MR) is marked "Approved" and "Ready to Merge."  
- **No merge button appears** for the user.  

---

### **Step 1: Validate Approval Eligibility**  
- **Check Commit History**:  
  1. Open the MR’s **Commits** tab.  
  2. If the **approver has committed changes** to the MR:  
     - ❌ Approval is **invalid** per SOD (Segregation of Duties).  
     - ✅ Solution: Get approval from a **non-committer** in the approval group.  

---

### **Step 2: Verify Project Membership**  
- **Who can merge?**:  
  - Only **project members** with Developer/Maintainer roles.  
  - If you’re an external contributor/guest:  
    - 🛑 You cannot merge even with approval.  
    - ✅ Solution: Ask a project member to merge.  

---

### **Step 3: Check Protected Branch Settings**  
- Navigate to **Protected Branches > Allowed to Merge**:  
  - If set to `No one`:  
    - 🛑 Merge button is hidden for **all users**.  
  - ✅ Solution: Update to `Developers + Maintainers` or a specific approval group.  

---

### **Other Checks**  
- **MR Status**: Ensure CI/CD pipelines (if any) are passing.  
- **Approval Rules**: Confirm required approvals are met (e.g., 2+ approvals).  

---

## Summary Table  

| Issue | Cause | Solution |  
|-------|-------|----------|  
| No merge button | Approver has commits in MR | Reassign approval to non-committer |  
| No merge button | User is not a project member | Ask project member to merge |  
| No merge button | Protected branch "Allowed to merge" = `No one` | Update branch settings |
